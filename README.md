# TableParse

Goals:
- learn setuptools to check dependencies
- portable
- parse websites, since many repetitive, annoying tasks involve web interfaces

There may be something else out there that does this, if there is and it is complicated, this will act as a wrapper. Else if there is and it is simple, project will be abandoned. Else, code on!


There is a library but must code with Jessi wooo
